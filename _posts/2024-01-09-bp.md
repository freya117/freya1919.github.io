# Business Plan Draft 1.0

In short: trafic path based facility recommendation system



imagine a world that you don't need to travel away to a crowded restaurant, but the dilicious will suddenly appear around you.  new events!! new restaurants!! new friends!! new opportunities!! new life!!



It's a new Yelp, not recommend you to visit a place, but bring the diliciours around you.



it's like a new Uber, not for taxi, but for facilities.

## Problem

even if people live in city for years, travel through the city for 2 hours per day, they will only know about 3 groups of facilities: 

    1. facilities around their home
    2. facilities around their work place
    3. facilities recommended by Ins and Yelp.

we can see that these three group pointer to 3 different kinds of urban functions: residential, work,and commercial. Usually, if someone want to go hangout with friends, he/she will go to the facilities around his/her home, or the facilities recommended by Ins and Yelp. the first one is limitated area, and the second one will cause huge traffic load.

The way people use facilities and the spatial correlation is weak, resulting in a lot of extra traffic demand and facility load on the basis of necessary traffic.

Maybe its a very Megacity problem? some more Asin area studies will help. 



## Solution

### product 1: metro advertisement system

at the first stage, due to lake of personal data, we will focus on the metro advertisement system: with metro system and POI around metro stations, we can build the system, and will recommend facilities to people based on their OD trafic path.

### product 2: personal facility recommendation application

as more and more people use our product, we will have more and more personal data, and we can build a personal facility recommendation application based on individual interest and daily path: recommend your future dinner plan!

### based algorithm

recommend facilities to people based on OD trafic path

### objective function:

Local index (need research support): extra distance consumption is the shortest; The highest recommended cumulative index

Overall indicator: Highest utilization rate of facilities, lowest traffic load.



## Company purpose

Based on people's trafic partten in Megacities, recommend facilities to them.

**to customer:** 

With this product, we will help people to save time and energy on finding facilities, and help facilities to get more customers.

**to city:** 

- A soft way of facility assolotation - for RealEstate economy; 
- reduce the traffic load caused by - people's extra trafic demand for far away facilities;

**to commercial facilities:** a new way of advertisement! more chance and more space for your new opportunities!

CFO: no reason. 

## some questions/todo I have now:

- which city should I start with in demo?

- should I builid this project with academic research (show its social impact and more science based optimization algoroithm development) or just a startup (demo or die)?

- Singepore is too small for our project? where should be the market research base?
