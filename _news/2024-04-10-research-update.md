Today marks the official launch of our "Write Out Loud" application for iPadOS! This innovative app leverages multimodal learning through synchronized kinesthetic and auditory inputs to enhance Chinese character learning.

## How It Works

The app combines Apple Pencil technology with speech recognition to create a comprehensive learning experience that engages multiple senses simultaneously. Users can write characters while speaking them aloud, receiving immediate feedback on both written form and pronunciation.

## Research Findings

Our preliminary user studies show that this multi-modal approach significantly improves character retention and recall compared to traditional learning methods. The application is particularly effective for learners who struggle with the visual complexity of Chinese characters.

## Get Involved

The app is now available in beta on TestFlight, and we welcome feedback from language educators and students. You can sign up to participate in our extended testing program through the project website.

Looking forward to seeing how this technology can help make Chinese language learning more accessible and effective!
