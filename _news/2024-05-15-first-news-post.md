I'm thrilled to share that our research on automated neighborhood archetypes for urban building energy modeling is progressing well. Working with the City Form Lab at MIT, we've developed a graph-based representation that can map cities into a spectrum of representative neighborhoods.

## Recent Progress

This model effectively captures both morphological characteristics and topological relationships within urban fabrics, enabling more accurate energy simulations at the community level.

Initial results show that our archetype-based approach reduces computational complexity by 65% compared to building-by-building modeling while maintaining accuracy within 12% of detailed models.

## Next Steps

Stay tuned for more updates as we expand this work to include more diverse urban contexts and incorporate temporal dynamics in energy use patterns!
