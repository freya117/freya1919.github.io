I'm pleased to announce that our paper on pedestrian volume estimation for Maine DOT has been accepted for presentation at the Urban Computing Conference 2024!

## Conference Details

The conference will take place June 15-17 in Boston, where I'll be sharing our methodology for developing a comprehensive model to estimate pedestrian activity across various urban and rural contexts in Maine.

## Research Impact

This work addresses the critical lack of pedestrian volume data that many transportation agencies face, enabling better decision-making around infrastructure planning and safety improvements for non-motorized street users.

## Connect with Me

If you're attending the conference, I'd love to connect and discuss potential collaborations or applications of this methodology in other regions.

Looking forward to sharing our findings and learning from other researchers in the urban computing community!
