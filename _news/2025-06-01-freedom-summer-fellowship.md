I'm excited to share that I've been selected as a 2025 Freedom Summer Fellow through the [Freedom Summer Fellowship Program](https://freedomsummerfellowship.com/), which connects graduate students with cities and organizations working on clean energy, climate resilience, and infrastructure justice.

## Partnership with Newark

This summer, I'll be partnering with the City of Newark Office of Sustainability and Emerald Cities Collaborative (ECC) to support the launch of Newark's extreme heat resilience initiatives. Our work will include program design, community engagement, and developing data-driven strategies for long-term climate adaptation and equity.

## Mission and Impact

The fellowship provides an incredible opportunity to contribute directly to environmental justice work while bridging academic research with real-world implementation. Newark's leadership in climate adaptation serves as a model for other cities facing similar challenges.

## Looking Forward

Grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important effort and to learn from the incredible leaders on the ground. Looking forward to helping build more resilient and just cities through data-driven approaches and community-centered design.
