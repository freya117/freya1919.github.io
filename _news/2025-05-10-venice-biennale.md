Excited to share that NYC Walks and Sidewalk Ballet, two projects developed by our team at MIT's City Form Lab, are now on display at the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale!

I had the chance to contribute to the Sidewalk Ballet project, an interdisciplinary effort exploring the social dynamics of urban sidewalks. It's been such a joy working with Liu Liu and Marco Cipriano from the Hasso Plattner Institute, our collaboration brought together computer vision and large language models to analyze and visualize public life across New York City's streetscapes.

If you'll be in Venice between May 10 and November 23, 2025, we warmly invite you to stop by and explore our work!

## About the Exhibition

The City Form Lab exhibit is part of the MIT Department of Architecture led exhibition "The Next Earth" at the Palazzo Diedo, the exhibition space of Berggruen Arts & Culture. Our projects examine the geography of foot-traffic and social interactions on the streets of New York through innovative computational methods and visualization techniques.
