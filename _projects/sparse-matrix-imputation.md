## Project Overview

Current sparse matrix modeling techniques, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), often use low-rank approximations to convert sparse matrices into denser, lower-dimensional forms for deep learning models. While these methods enhance computational efficiency, they struggle to preserve the nuanced relationships in the original data, which is crucial for tasks requiring structural or contextual information, such as temporal analysis, sensor networks, and various scientific fields involving high-dimensional or structured data.

## Approach

We propose a model that processes sparse matrices directly, learning intrinsic patterns and relationships without relying on low-rank approximations. Our research addresses a significant limitation in existing approaches: when inputting sparse matrices into autoencoders (AEs), models often bias toward zero-value areas, neglecting patterns in data-dense regions.

To solve this problem, we developed a **multi-objective loss function** that:

- Balances learning from both data-dense and sparse regions
- Dynamically adjusts during training to prioritize meaningful patterns
- Preserves structural relationships in the original data

## Methodology

Our approach consists of several key components:

1. **Custom Autoencoder Architecture**: Designed specifically for sparse matrix inputs with attention mechanisms to focus on data-dense regions
2. **Multi-Objective Loss Function**: Combines reconstruction loss with pattern preservation metrics
3. **Dynamic Weighting Scheme**: Automatically adjusts loss weights during training based on input sparsity patterns

We evaluated our model across multiple domains, including sensor network data, user-item interaction matrices, and scientific datasets with inherent sparsity.

## Results

Our method demonstrates significant improvements over traditional approaches:

- **Higher accuracy** in reconstructing values in data-dense regions
- **Better preservation** of structural relationships between data points
- **More robust performance** on varying levels of sparsity

## Applications

This research has applications in:

- Recommender systems with sparse user-item interaction matrices
- Sensor networks with missing data points
- Scientific computing with high-dimensional sparse datasets
- Network analysis with incomplete connection data

## Future Work

We are currently extending this work to integrate with graph neural networks for improved structural learning and exploring semi-supervised approaches that can leverage partial labeling in sparse datasets.
