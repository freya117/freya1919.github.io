## Design and Planning Strategy

The project utilizes a multi-layered approach:
- Identification of suitable cultivation zones within the urban context
- Development of integrated production-to-market value chains
- Creation of educational and training facilities for industry skills
- Design of public spaces that celebrate floral heritage
- Implementation of sustainable growing practices and technologies

## Economic Development Components

The economic revitalization strategy includes:
