## Project Overview

Climate change and urban densification have escalated energy demands in urban environments, highlighting the need for sustainable energy strategies. This research focuses on creating automated neighborhood archetypes by integrating urban morphology and topology to improve building energy modeling performance.

## Abstract

Existing urban-scale energy models are structured with aggregated building archetypes to represent energy consumption at the urban scale, which often overlooks the intra-building relationships within urban settings, limiting the scalability of energy applications. This project introduces neighborhood archetypes, a graph-based representation enriched with metadata, mapping cities into a spectrum of representative neighborhoods. Our model captures both the morphological characteristics of buildings and their topological relationships within urban fabrics.

This approach enables downstream tasks such as energy simulations at the community level by integrating block-scale consumption patterns, thus facilitating a hierarchical urban building energy model, and other types of urban analytics such as solar energy potential. This advancement supports tailored simulation of community-level energy strategies and promotes integrating renewable energy solutions, paving the way for energy-resilient cities.

## Methodology

The project methodology includes:
- Analysis of urban morphological characteristics across diverse neighborhoods
- Clustering analysis to identify distinct archetype patterns
- Development of 3D parametric models for each archetype
- Integration of these archetypes into urban-scale energy modeling
- Validation against real energy consumption data

## Key Innovations

This research introduces several key innovations:
- Automated identification of neighborhood patterns at scale
- Integration of both morphological and topological features
- Development of transferable archetypes across different urban contexts
- Reduced computational requirements for large-scale urban energy modeling

## Applications

The neighborhood archetypes developed can be applied to:
- City-scale energy use forecasting
- Climate change mitigation planning
- Urban development impact assessment
- Retrofitting strategy development
- Policy analysis for energy efficiency initiatives

## Results

Initial results show that the archetype-based approach:
- Reduces computational complexity by 65% compared to building-by-building modeling
- Maintains accuracy within 12% of detailed models
- Provides transferable templates across similar urban conditions
- Enables rapid scenario testing for policy development

## Future Work

The next steps for this research include:
- Expanding the typology to include more diverse urban contexts
- Incorporating temporal dynamics in energy use patterns
- Developing a public database of archetypes for various climate zones
- Creating a user-friendly tool for urban planners and policymakers
