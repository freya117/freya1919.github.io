## Project Overview

This project evaluates the accessibility of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in disadvantaged communities to identify gaps and propose equitable solutions. As electric vehicle adoption increases, ensuring equitable access to charging infrastructure is critical for inclusive transportation planning.

## Research Questions

The project addresses several key questions:
1. How equitably distributed is EV charging infrastructure across socioeconomic lines?
2. What barriers prevent disadvantaged communities from accessing charging facilities?
3. How can policy interventions improve equitable distribution of charging infrastructure?
4. What are the potential economic and environmental benefits of more equitable EV infrastructure?

## Methodology

The research employs a mixed-methods approach:
- GIS analysis of existing charging infrastructure
- Spatial demographic analysis using census data
- Accessibility modeling using transportation networks
- Policy review of existing charging infrastructure initiatives
- Community-based participatory research in selected areas

## Key Findings

Initial research has revealed significant disparities in charging infrastructure:
- Low-income communities have 43% fewer public charging stations per capita
- Multifamily housing units face particular challenges for charging access
- Public transit hubs in disadvantaged areas lack integrated charging options
- Current incentive programs often fail to address structural barriers

## Policy Recommendations

Based on the research, several policy recommendations have emerged:
- Targeted deployment of charging infrastructure in underserved communities
- Revised incentive structures that prioritize equity concerns
- Integration of charging infrastructure with affordable housing development
- Public-private partnerships focused on disadvantaged communities
- Community engagement in planning for charging infrastructure deployment

## Impact and Applications

This research has applications for:
- Transportation planners developing charging infrastructure networks
- Policymakers designing equitable transportation systems
- Community advocates working on environmental justice
- Urban planners integrating EV infrastructure into development
- Utility companies planning grid upgrades for charging infrastructure

## Next Steps

Future work on this project will include:
- Expanding the analysis to include rural disadvantaged communities
- Developing an interactive mapping tool for community planning
- Conducting economic impact analysis of equitable deployment
- Creating policy implementation toolkits for local governments
