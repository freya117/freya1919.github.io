## Project Overview

This project focuses on advancing climate resilience and mitigating extreme heat and air quality impacts in Newark, NJ. It involves implementing targeted, place-based interventions in ten disadvantaged neighborhoods across Newark's five wards, identified based on need related to urban heat island effects, pollution, and social vulnerability.

Key components include implementing Green Infrastructure (GI), Resilient Small Transit Shelters (RESTS), cooling surfaces, and enhancing community resilience hubs.

The project is led by the City of Newark Office of Sustainability (OoS) as the Lead Applicant, with South Ward Environmental Alliance (SWEA) as the Statutory Partner. It is supported by a broad network of Collaborating Entities (CEs), other City departments (like Health, Public Works, Workforce Development, Libraries), and academic institutions (NJIT, Princeton University).

The project is funded, in part, by an EPA Community Change Grant. The anticipated project duration is 36 months, starting around June 1, 2025, and ending around May 31, 2028.

## Background and Motivation

Newark faces significant environmental challenges stemming from its industrial legacy and systemic disinvestment, resulting in disproportionate impacts on low-income residents and communities of color. The city experiences a pronounced urban heat island effect, with temperatures up to 9Â°F hotter in some areas, posing significant health risks like heat-related illnesses.

Poor air quality and high asthma rates are also persistent problems. Public transit users, who are often vulnerable populations, lack adequate protection from extreme weather at existing bus stops.

The project is motivated by the need to address environmental injustices, improve public health, and build climate resilience for those most vulnerable. It aligns with the community vision outlined in the Newark360 Master Plan for a healthier, more equitable, and resilient city.

## Research Gap and Innovation

The project addresses a gap in achieving community resilience, particularly concerning resilience hubs, by developing clearer messaging and foundational programming. It seeks to pilot innovative, place-based solutions that are resident-informed and customized to neighborhood needs.

Innovative technologies like retroreflective surfaces for quick heat mitigation are utilized. The RESTS design incorporates multiple features (green roofs, solar, thermal walls, misting) and surrounding GI, aiming to be a replicable model.

The development of a Resilience Hub Playbook and "plug-and-play" resilience programs (workforce, student success, citizen science) is a strategy to empower communities and scale programming beyond infrastructure.

A core innovation is the "whole-of-community" collaborative governance model that integrates stakeholders at all levels in decision-making. Integrating citizen science for hyperlocal data collection and community empowerment is a key approach.

## Methodology

The project utilizes a phased approach for specific interventions like RESTS (Design, Installation, Evaluation). Implementation is guided by a "whole-of-community" approach, fostering collaboration between City departments, CBOs, universities, and residents.

Key activities include:
- Installing Green Infrastructure like rain gardens (30 planned) and permeable pavements (28,500 sq ft planned)
- Tree Planting Initiative: creating 1,750 tree pits and planting 2,000 trees, integrated with a mulching program
- Deploying 20 RESTS equipped with solar panels, green roofs, thermal walls, and misting features along transit routes
- Applying Cool Roof coatings on residential and municipal buildings (40,000 sq ft targeted) and installing retroreflective surfaces on specific sites like libraries and potentially playgrounds
- Retrofitting municipal buildings for energy efficiency and indoor air quality
- Developing and running workforce development programs (urban forestry, green building skills) and student success programs related to the green economy
- Implementing citizen science programs for monitoring air quality and temperature using sensors and take-home kits
- Developing a Resilience Hub Playbook outlining a vision, classification system, and planning guidance for community facilities
- Strengthening the Heat Preparedness Task Force to integrate community leadership and scale successful strategies
- Conducting feasibility studies and data analysis to inform project design and evaluate impact

## Data Sources

Existing data sources like UHI indices, tree canopy coverage, social vulnerability indices, and air quality data are used for needs assessment and site selection. Baseline environmental data will be collected through air quality and surface temperature monitoring prior to implementation.

Sensors (indoor and outdoor air quality, thermal comfort, weather monitoring stations) will be deployed for real-time and post-implementation data collection. Thermal imaging cameras will be used to measure temperature improvements.

Data collected through citizen science initiatives will supplement technical monitoring. Qualitative data and feedback will be gathered through community workshops, surveys, feedback mechanisms (QR codes, phone numbers), and engagement sessions.

Performance metrics (outputs and outcomes) will be systematically tracked and reported. Utility data, municipal fleet data, and existing program participation rates (e.g., energy efficiency) are used for planning and evaluation of related initiatives.

## Expected Outcomes

- Reduced exposure to extreme heat and poor air quality for vulnerable populations in target neighborhoods
- Improved public health outcomes, such as reduced heat-related illnesses and asthma attacks
- Lowered localized temperatures and mitigation of urban heat island effects through green infrastructure and cooling surfaces
- Enhanced community resilience to climate hazards, including heat and flooding
- Increased energy efficiency in buildings and broader adoption of clean energy technologies (solar, cool roofs, EVs)
- Creation of green jobs and expanded workforce capacity for residents in sustainable sectors
- Strengthened community empowerment and engagement in climate action and decision-making processes
- Development of replicable models and resources (Technical Manuals, Playbook) to facilitate scaling of interventions citywide and beyond
- Improved stormwater management and reduced combined sewer overflows (CSOs)
- Potential energy cost savings for residents and the City
- Increased access to fresh food and support for urban agriculture initiatives in related OoS work

## Applications and Future Work

The project's deliverables, including the RESTS Technical Manual and the Resilience Hub Playbook, are designed to serve as replicable frameworks for implementing similar projects in other areas of Newark and potentially other municipalities.

The workforce development curricula will be packaged and available for future training programs, creating a sustainable pipeline of skilled workers for the green economy. The citizen science program establishes long-term community capacity for environmental monitoring and advocacy.

The "whole-of-community" governance model and strengthened partnerships are intended to sustain collaborative decision-making and implementation beyond the grant period. The City plans to integrate project maintenance (e.g., RESTS) into its capital budget and existing operations.

Successful pilot projects will be leveraged to attract additional funding from public and private sources for scaling initiatives. Data collected and lessons learned will inform future updates to City plans and policies, such as the Heat Preparedness Plan, energy strategies, zoning regulations, and green infrastructure standards.

The project aims to serve as a model for scalable, community-driven climate resilience initiatives for other cities.
