## Project Overview

Newark faces increasingly dangerous extreme heat events, disproportionately impacting historically underserved communities with limited access to green space, cooling infrastructure, and health resources. As a Freedom Summer Fellow, I worked with the City of Newark's Office of Sustainability (OoS) to advance urban heat resilience initiatives across the city.

## Challenges & Response

The Office of Sustainability is launching a series of heat resilience initiatives including:
- Cool Roof Program
- Resilient Small Transit Shelters (RESTS)
- Long-term Heat Resilience Coalition

These programs aim to provide immediate relief while building long-term infrastructure for climate adaptation and environmental justice.

## My Contributions

I supported the OoS in several key areas:

- **Spatial Analysis**: Developed site recommendations for RESTS deployment based on vulnerability, transit use, and temperature exposure
- **Program Design**: Created strategic recommendations for scaling the Cool Roof Program and applying cool/permeable surface interventions
- **Data Framework**: Designed a monitoring and evaluation framework with key indicators and data collection tools
- **Community Engagement**: Prepared facilitation materials for the June 26-27 community Un-Conference, including session guides and post-event summaries
- **Coalition Building**: Drafted plans for the Heat Resilience Coalition, including stakeholder mapping and governance structure

## Impact

My work helped shape Newark's long-term strategy to protect residents from extreme heat, particularly in the most vulnerable neighborhoods. These contributions directly informed city policy, strengthened community trust, and supported sustainable funding proposals. By building the foundation for a coordinated heat resilience response, I helped Newark work toward becoming a model for urban climate adaptation grounded in equity and community leadership.
