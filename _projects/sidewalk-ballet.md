## Project Overview

This project originated from my thesis, which involved the collection of millions of photos from 26 cities. The objective was to utilize deep learning to analyze urban social activities through visual content analysis.

## Methodology

The research utilized a combination of:
- Computer vision techniques for feature detection
- Machine learning for activity classification
- Spatial analysis to map social interactions
- Integration with urban planning frameworks

## Outcomes

The SideWalk Ballet project provides insights into how people interact with urban spaces across different cities, times of day, and contextual settings. The analysis reveals patterns of social activities that can inform urban planning decisions and public space design.

Key findings include:
- Identification of activity hotspots across urban environments
- Temporal patterns of social behaviors in public spaces
- Correlation between urban design elements and social activities
- Framework for quantifying and qualifying social vibrancy

## Applications

The methods and findings from this project can be applied to:
- Urban planning and public space design
- Social impact assessment for development projects
- Pedestrian planning and walkability improvements
- Community activity trend analysis

## Future Development

Future work on this project includes:
- Expanding the dataset to include more cities
- Incorporating temporal analysis to understand seasonal variations
- Developing interactive tools for urban planners
- Creating a public API for urban researchers
