## Project Overview

The Boston Walker project examines pedestrian movement patterns and infrastructure quality throughout Boston to identify areas for improvement and enhance walkability. Using a combination of sensor data, computer vision, and survey methods, this research provides insights into pedestrian behavior and infrastructure needs.

## Research Goals

The project aims to:
- Quantify pedestrian activity patterns across Boston neighborhoods
- Evaluate the quality and accessibility of pedestrian infrastructure
- Identify correlations between urban form and walking behavior
- Develop recommendations for pedestrian-friendly improvements
- Create a replicable methodology for other cities

## Methodology

The research employs multiple complementary approaches:
- Deployment of pedestrian counters at key locations
- Computer vision analysis of street-level imagery to assess infrastructure quality
- Street audits using standardized walkability assessment tools
- Integration with city data on demographics, land use, and transportation
- Spatial analysis to identify patterns and relationships

## Key Findings

Initial findings from the research include:
- Significant variations in pedestrian infrastructure quality across neighborhoods
- Strong correlations between commercial density and pedestrian activity
- Weather-dependent patterns in pedestrian behavior
- High-priority areas for sidewalk improvements based on condition and usage
- The importance of street furniture and amenities for pedestrian comfort

## Applications

The project has practical applications for:
- Urban planners prioritizing pedestrian infrastructure improvements
- Transportation departments allocating resources
- Public health officials promoting active transportation
- Community advocates seeking data-driven arguments for improvements
- Developers interested in walkable neighborhood characteristics

## Innovations

The Boston Walker project introduces several methodological innovations:
- Automated assessment of sidewalk quality using computer vision
- Integration of real-time weather data with pedestrian counts
- Development of a composite walkability index for Boston
- Creation of interactive visualization tools for planners and the public
- Participatory sensing approaches involving community members

## Future Directions

Future work on this project will include:
- Expanding the sensor network to cover more neighborhoods
- Developing predictive models for pedestrian activity
- Creating design guidelines based on high-performing pedestrian spaces
- Collaborating with city agencies on implementation strategies
- Building an open data platform for ongoing monitoring
