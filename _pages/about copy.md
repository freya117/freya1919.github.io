Hi!👋  This is **Yifeng Liu** [刘伊丰]. [Here is my CV.pdf](/assets/pdf/yifengCV.pdf)

Graduated from [SATU@Tsinghua](http://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Home), I will join [DUSP@MIT](https://dusp.mit.edu/) as a master student. My experience lies in architecture design, data representation, and urban analysis. I am interested in exploring the relationship between different urban behaviors and the social/physical structure. 

I also enjoy playing rock music🎵 and baseball⚾️ in my spare time. Please feel free to contact me if you are looking for a bassist or a second baseman in Cambridge.😉
