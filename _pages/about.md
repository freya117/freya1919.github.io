## Bio

I am a Master's student at MIT in EECS and DUSP. My research focuses on the intersection of urban science, human mobility, and computational methods. I use machine learning and data science approaches to tackle complex urban planning challenges.

Currently, I'm a researcher at the <a href="https://cityform.mit.edu/">City Form Lab</a> at MIT, where my work focuses on pedestrian activity modeling and social behavior detection. My projects include analyzing social activities through urban visual content, developing neighborhood archetypes for energy modeling, and assessing transportation equity.

Prior to MIT, I was at UC Berkeley, where I developed a strong foundation in urban systems and human mobility research. I've worked on multiple interdisciplinary projects combining architecture, urban planning, and computational analysis.

I'm passionate about integrating urban planning with spatial analytics and mobility research, aiming to create more sustainable, equitable, and livable urban environments through data-driven approaches and human-centered design.
